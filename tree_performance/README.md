# Tree performance evaluations.

Scripts and programs to evaluate the performance of different tree implementations.

All scripts are intended to be run **in this directory**

**NOTE** This directory is left-over from an earlier vision for the paper when we 
were interested in doing benchmarks and illustrating tskit's performance. It's 
not relevatn to the short announcement-style, but there is a lot of good work
in here, so keeping it lying around in case it ever becomes relevant for 
a different, technical paper.
