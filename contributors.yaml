repository: tskit-dev/tskit
generated_at_utc: '2026-01-15T15:50:47Z'
note: This is curated by first looking at Git commits from the tskit-dev/tskit
  repository (using the script fetch_contributors.py) as a first pass, and
  then trying to informally add contributions from tszip, tskit-rust,
  and tutorials repos.
