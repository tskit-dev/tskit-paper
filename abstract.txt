Ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) are an increasingly important component
of population and statistical genetics. The tskit library has become key
infrastructure for the field, providing an expressive and general
representation of ARGs together with a suite of efficient fundamental
operations. In this note, we announce tskit version 1.0, describe its
underlying rationale, and document its stability guarantees. These guarantees
provide a foundation for durable computational artefacts and support long-term
reproducibility of code and analyses.
