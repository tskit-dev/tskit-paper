\opening{Dear Editors,}

I am writing on behalf of my coauthors to submit our manuscript entitled
\emph{Population-scale Ancestral Recombination
Graphs with tskit 1.0}
for consideration for publication in Nature Methods
as a Correspondence article.
The purpose of the manuscript is to announce the release of tskit 1.0,
marking an important milestone of maturity for the software.

We believe that this will be of strong interest to the readership
of Nature Methods for two reasons. Firstly, as outlined in the
manuscript, there is now great interest in the practical application
of Ancestral Recombination Graphs across varied applications
in population and statistical genetics. Beyond the three review
articles articles published in 2024 that are cited in the manuscript,
there has been several other opinion pieces published on the
great promise of ARGs\cite{harris2019database,tang2019genealogy}



\closing{Sincerely,}
