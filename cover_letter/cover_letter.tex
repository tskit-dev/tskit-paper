\opening{Dear Editors,}

I am writing on behalf of my coauthors to submit our manuscript
\textbf{Population-scale Ancestral Recombination Graphs with tskit 1.0}
for consideration as a \textbf{Correspondence} in Nature Methods.
% [One line description of the contribution]
This article announces the release of tskit 1.0, marking a stable
versioned data model and API for representing and manipulating ancestral recombination
graphs (ARGs) at population scale.

ARG-based approaches are increasingly used across population and statistical
genetics, but their practical adoption has been limited by fragmented data
representations and bespoke tooling.
Tskit provides a semantically complete and efficient representation of
genetic ancestry that enables interoperability across methods and scales
from thousands to millions of samples.
The philosophy and design of tskit aims to provide the sort of stable, fundamental, and efficient tooling
that is provided by tools like bedtools or bcftools in current workflows.
The purpose of the Correspondence is to document the transition of tskit to
long-term stable infrastructure,
% and to articulate the intent and guarantees
% associated with its 1.0 release, supporting a broad range of simulation,
% inference, and analysis methods.
% With the release of version 1.0, tskit formally 
and the associated stability guarantees for its data model and core APIs. 
This will allow downstream developers to continue to build new methods
on a shared and dependable foundation.
The manuscript clarifies the core goal of providing a library focused on
well-tested primitive operations, and highlights the ecosystem of independent
tools that has been built around it.
We intend this Correspondence to serve as a stable, citable reference for tskit 1.0 moving forwards.

\closing{Sincerely,}
